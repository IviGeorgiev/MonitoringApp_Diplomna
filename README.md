MonitoringApp is a mobile application that aims to allow nature lovers to take part in conservation and view recordings of interesting species.

# About
Due to human activity and industry, an increasing number of species are threatened with extinction. Since the beginning of the First Industrial Revolution in 1750, more than 560 animal and plant species have become extinct.

To address this problem, governments, organizations, and scientists are establishing reserves, protected areas, and various methods of wildlife monitoring. However, there is a shortage of personnel who can participate in such activities.

The goal of this project is to address the issue through a mobile application that will allow non-professionals to collect and share data on different species. Through these observations, people will have the opportunity to learn more about the environment and find more motivation to preserve and explore it.

# Features


The app has the following functionalities:
* Login and Registration
* Profile management
* Access to a list of observations
* Option to add and edit observations
* Option to upload photos

* Map with the users location
